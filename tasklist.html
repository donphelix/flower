                    These are what I am hoping to do as well as the time it will take for their
                     accomplishment
            </h4>
            <div>
                    <ol>
                            <li>I have designed this project majorly for the mobile phone user as described
                                in the instruction and anything can be changed when need be.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>
                                This project need a registration form which with my experience can take three days when am using
                                pure php css3 and html5 but it can take half a day with laravel and bootsrap because laravel has a very 
                                powerful registration that only needs to be authenticated from the terminal.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>
                                The record from the form need to be submitted to the server, so we can use pure php or php framework(laravel) which can take
                                not less than a day.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>Before submitting all the records, there should be server to store the data. 
                                So we would create a server.
                                This can take two days because we have to create all the tables and how they are related to each other
                            I believe this project would need a diverse server with all the inheritance required</li>
                            <br><li>
                                I would prefer working with laravel to make things easier for faster delivery to the client.
                                Using laravel migrations and Eloquent, the backend and frontend can take shorter time.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>
                                Since this is a mobile phone design we can use javascript jQuery or angular framework to save mobile user 
                                on too much reload when submiting data
                                to the server and fetching data from the server.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>
                                In the add more bugs button in the form I would use javascript to make the user add more bugs by
                                duplicating the input text and select bug stage
                            </li><br>
                            <li>
                                I would use the submitted date from the server to create a condition so that the 
                                record is only taken after every one week, after which the Submit button will be active.
                                The user can be notified as well to take data at the speculated date.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>
                                In total to fully furnish the project it would take two weeks or two and a half weeks.
                                <br> Thank you.
                            </li>
